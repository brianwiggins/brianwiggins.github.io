## Welcome to Brian's github page

If you've made it this far, you're probably interested in Brian's professional ability.
Unfortunately, you'll have to learn about his hobbies and interests first.


### About Brian 

Brian's an avid outdoorsman and beer enthusiast who happens to also have a knack for software engineering. He's been in Boise for the majority of his life now, and doesn't plan on leaving any time too soon (making one exception for beautiful Alaska). Brian loves hunting, fishing, backpacking and skiing, but most of all, he loves spending time with his beloved cat, Stubbs. Brian studies Computer Science at Boise State University (expected graduation Dec 2021). At Boise State, he was a part of the mechanical engineering club, and he volunteered with `https://ystemandchess.com/` to help teach programming and logical thinking skills to kids in lower-income schools. Brian began getting into programming when he was required to take a CS class toward his Mechanical engineering degree, and his life was forever changed when he changed his major and got to work on some cool code. Software engineering would forever be his passion. Prior to the Covid-19 epidemic in the US, Brian attended Codeworks bootcamp in Boise, ID, where he learned a bunch of cool stuff. Alright, now you can check out his projects. 


### Projects and proof of experience

Go ahead and take a look at just a few of his public projects on github `(https://github.com/brianwiggins)`. Some that aren't hosted by github that he's really proud of are:

Note that this site is a mobile-first developed application utilizing javascript and Node.js

```ukanban.herokuapp.com```
An older project of Brian's, but something that he's really proud of.
